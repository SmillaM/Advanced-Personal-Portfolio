 HKR JavaScript for web development
1. Used ChatGPT to Brainstorm titles for the navbar.
2. To insert the social media icons, I added https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0-beta3/css/all.min.css in my head tag. 
3. To make my social media icons to look clickable, I made a :hover selector for .social-media a and transformed the scale to 1.05.
4. I made a * (all) selector to add a solid border, to make it easier for me to see the layout and its containers.
5. I changed name of a class in HTML, which messed up the styling. So I had to change the name in CSS as well. 
6. I got stuck when I wanted to give the main img a 5% margin-right. So I asked ChatGPT for help and it told me to replace space-between, in justify-content, with flex-start since it overrided the other margins for main img and main .intro.
